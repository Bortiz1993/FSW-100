My Reflection Assignment.

<p>1st: To start things off, what I aspire to be as a Web Dev would probably be
    to be a Debugger and a Web Designer. Eventually I want to get to IT or Cyber Security.
 2nd: I plan to build on my skills by creating more Websites, getting some more tutoring and joining more coding activities.
3rd: I think my favorite topics where the basics of HTML but I really like CSS. All of the stylings are pretty fun.
 4th: I think my biggest accomplishments were my Responsive Website number 2 and my favorite, my chocolate shop.
 5th: The insights that I have gained are pretty big compared to the start. I have more knowledge about coding that I ever had.
6th: HTML and CSS both are part of my end goals, eventually I want to work for IT or Cyber Security.
I want to create and design the Websites of course.
